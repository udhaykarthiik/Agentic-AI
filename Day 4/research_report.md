Climate stabilization remains elusive, with increased greenhouse gas concentrations already increasing global average surface temperatures 1.1 °C above pre-industrial levels (World Meteorological Organization 2019).Carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from fossil fuel use, deforestation, and other anthropogenic sources reached ∼ 43 billion metric tonnes in 2019 (Friedlingstein et al 2019...

Anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) have made significant contributions to global warming since the pre-industrial period and are therefore targeted in international climate policy. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated in its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) that rising atmospheric concentrations of CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O have already caused global mean surface temperature (GMST) to increase by 1.4 °C (0.9–2.2 °C at the ...

This has come about because of sea-level rise, extreme weather events, changes in precipitation, and increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the water. Mangrove systems are crucial because they act as sea defence systems protecting the coastal line, controlling water flow speed and reducing the impact on coastal infrastructure....

The impacts of climate change and sea-level rise around the Pacific and Arctic Oceans can vary tremendously. Thus far the vast majority of national and international impact assessments and models of coastal climate change have focused on low-relief coastlines that are not near seismically active zones. Furthermore, the degree to which extreme waves and wind will add further stress to coastal...

### Source 5: Sea-Level Rise and Its Impact on Coastal Zones | Science - AAAS
The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected that global sea level will rise by up to ~60 cm by 2100 in response to ocean warming and glaciers melting ().However, the recently identified accelerated decline of polar ice sheet mass (2-5) raises the possibility of future sea-level rise (SLR) of 1 m or more by 2100 (6, 7)....

## 3. To what extent do changes in precipitation patterns (both intensity and frequency) associated with climate change influence the spread and virulence of vector-borne diseases (e.g., malaria, Zika) in a defined geographic area over a specified timeframe, and what are the resulting public health implications?
### Source 1: Climate change and changes in global precipitation patterns: What do we ...
However, during the last two to three decades, there have been some increases in the globally combined severe dry and wet areas, resulting from increases in either the dry area, e.g., over the Sahel, eastern Asia and southern Africa or the wet areas, e.g., over the United States and Europe. Most of the increases occurred after 1970....

Precipitation varies from year to year and over decades, and changes in amount, intensity, frequency, and type (e.g. snow vs. rain) affect the environment and society. Steady moderate rains soak into the soil and beneﬁt plants, while the same amounts of rainfall in a short period of time may cause local ﬂo oding and runoff,...

### Source 3: How does climate change affect precipitation? | NASA Global ...
How does climate change affect precipitation? Current climate models indicate that rising temperatures will intensify the Earth’s water cycle, increasing evaporation. Increased evaporation will result in more frequent and intense storms, but will also contribute to drying over some land areas. As a result, storm-affected areas are likely to experience increases in precipitation and increased risk of flooding, while areas located far away from storm tracks are likely to experience less precipitat...
